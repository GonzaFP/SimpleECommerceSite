# Simple E-Commerce Site

This is a simple imitation of a modern E-commerce site. A user can browse products according to their categories or search for them, he/she can add/remove cart items and when he/she is ready to buy an item, there is a check-out form to fill.
This project was built with the aim of practising and honing my skills in the following areas:

- Styled components.
- API calls and promises.
- Debouncing.
- React hooks such as useContext, useNavigation, useReducer, useParams and useSearchParams.
- Working with json-server and react router. The latter entailed seamless navigation from one page to another.
  Overall, my skills in React have greatly improved.
